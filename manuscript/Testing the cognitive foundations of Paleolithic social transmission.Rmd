abstract: |
  Stone tools provide key evidence of human cognitive evolution but remain difficult to interpret. Toolmaking skill-learning in particular has been understudied even though: 1) the most salient cognitive demands of toolmaking should occur during learning, and 2) variation in learning aptitude would have provided the raw material for any past selection acting on tool making ability. However, we actually know very little about the cognitive prerequisites of learning under different information transmission conditions that may have prevailed during the Paleolithic. This paper presents results from a pilot experimental study to trial new experimental methods for studying the effect of learning conditions and individual differences on Oldowan flake-tool making skill acquisition. We trained 23 participants for 2 hours to make stone flakes under two different instructional conditions (observation only vs. direct active teaching) employing appropriate raw materials, practice time, and real human interaction. Participant performance was evaluated through analysis of the stone artifacts produced. Performance was compared both across experimental groups and with respect to individual participant differences in grip strength, motor accuracy, and cognitive function measured for the study. Our results show aptitude to be associated with fluid intelligence in a verbally instructed group and with a tendency to use social information in an observation-only group. These results have implications for debates surrounding the cumulative nature of human culture, the relative contributions of knowledge and know-how for stone tool making, and the role of evolved psychological mechanisms in “high fidelity” transmission of information, particularly through imitation and teaching.

# Introduction {#intro}

Stone tools have long been seen as a key source of evidence for understanding human behavioral and cognitive evolution [@darwin1871; @oakley1949; @washburn1960]. Pathbreaking attempts to infer specific cognitive capacities from this evidence largely focused on the basic requirements of tool production [@isaac1976; @wynn1979; @gowlett1984; @wynn2004]. More recently, increasing attention has been directed to the processes and demands of stone tool making skill acquisition [@roux1995; @stout2002; @stout2005; @geribàs2010; @nonaka2010; @stout2011; @putt2014; @hecht2015; @duke2015; @morgan2015; @stout2015; @lombao2017; @putt2017; @cataldo2018; @putt2019; @pargeter2019; @pargeter2020]. This is motivated by the expectation that the most salient cognitive demands of tool making should occur during learning rather than routine expert performance [@stout2015] and by interest in the relevance of different social learning mechanisms such as imitation [@rein2014; @stout2019], emulation [@tehrani2008; @wilkins2018], and language [@ohnuma1997; @putt2014; @morgan2015; @lombao2017; @putt2017; @cataldo2018] to the reproduction of Paleolithic technologies.
